# Image Rotation Prediction
Using transfer learning with VGG to predict image rotation angle

This is a copy of a kaggle notebook that can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayalaco/image-rotation-prediction-with-transfer-learning
The dataset can be found there as well.

The goal here was to play around with transfer learning (use pretrained models for feature extraction) and train the model to detect image angles. 
VGG16 was found to be the most useful pretrained model for this purpose.
